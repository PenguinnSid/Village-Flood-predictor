# Village-Flood-predictor
Given a heightmap and segmentation map of the village, uses a CNN to predict the floodmap and find ideal places to place architecture such as levees to minimize the impact of floods.

Made a Convolutional Neural Network trained on the heightmap, segmentation map and floodmaps of 200 datapoints in a dataset.

Used it to predict the flood map of a village, and an algorithm to identify the most impacted parts of the village and find the ideal placement of architecture such as levees to minimize the impact of floods.

Flood_map - To predict the floodmap and build the architecture in the village
Model - To create the CNN model
